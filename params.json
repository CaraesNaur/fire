{"name":"Fire","tagline":"oldschool fire effect in javascript","body":"# Oldschool fire effect with javascript + html5 canvas\r\n\r\nForked from https://github.com/oem/fire.\r\n\r\nRefactored the Fire JS object to use prototype functions.\r\n\r\nAdded a default palette of 100 RGB triplets.  Pass in another array as the 6th\r\nargument to the Fire constructor.\r\n\r\nEnsured that the canvas[y][x] values remain within the range 0 to the number of\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nAdded burn() and out() functions to start/stop the fire.  The timeout is now a\r\nproperty of the Fire object.\r\n\r\nAdded 7th Fire constructor argument, speed, used as the delay argument for the\r\nanimation timeout.\r\n\r\nChanged a lot of what happens inside interpolate_point().  Three new fire\r\nproperties (cf1, cf2, focus) affect how much a color cools.  The cf1 and cf2\r\nproperties determine the random cooling range, focus sets how much influence\r\nthe original color has in determining the cooled color.\r\n\r\nMoved the instantiation into the html file; fire.js is now just the object code.\r\n\r\nPut a new look and feel into the HTML/CSS.  Add a click handler to the canvas to\r\nallow the fire to be paused.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
